Welcome to my unremarkable home on the web.
<br><br>

I'm an Engineering student pursuing Bachelor in <b>Computer Engineering</b> that likes to solve difficult problems at the intersection of technology and humanity. As a programmer I work across the stack with a specialty in back-end. Specialized in Web Development and UX/UI designing.
I have decent command over various programming languages like C/C++, Java, PHP, SQL, MYSQL, Python, HTML, CSS, Assembly Language. With this I am familiar with various frameworks compatible with the above mentioned languages.

  <li>Realtime CO2 Emission Control Device For Vehicle</li>
  <dd>This is an IoT product which will be installed on the carâ€™s exhaust with a case to resist heat. It consist of 4 sensors which detects different parameters and send it to remote server. This product is an intelligent gas detector for real time monitoring of CO2 and CO emissions in vehicles using Cognitive Internet of things. The model is cost effective and can be easily produced and integrated with vehicles.
  Additional features are crrently been added and will be finally presented as my Final Year Project which is led by me, we are using OpenCV and <b>Machine Learning</b> to get detail of vehicle by <b>Computer Vision</b>.
